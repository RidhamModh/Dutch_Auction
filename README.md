# Dutch_Auction

This project asks you to build a decentralized application for a Dutch Auction. The project has multiple milestones, one due every week until the last class of the semester. Each milestone will build upon the work of previous milestones. As noted in the syllabus, you have seven late-days across all homeworks throughout the semester.

Each milestone is due on the date specified in the table below. Submit each completed milestone to canvas as a link to a GitHub repo and a tagged commit with the version #.
